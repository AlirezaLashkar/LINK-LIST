# LINK-LIST
In the "Link List" project, in addition to "Link List", I also implemented "Queue" and designed the required functions.The commands required by each function are written.
# Circular-Link-List
In this part of the project, we implemented a circular link list that can be used in many tasks.
# Balanc-With-stack
With the use of Stack, we introduced a definition called balance, which we have explained in the project as examples of whether an expression is balanced or not.
The working method is as follows: we enter each statement such as "{ } () []" into the stack, then we remove the statements from the stack based on a special algorithm. If the stack is empty at the end, it is a balance statement. , and if it was not, the expression is not balanced.
